## Exercise: Create an Array Manipulation Utility

Create a JavaScript function called arrayManipulator that takes two arguments:

1. An input array of numbers.
2. A configuration object that specifies the operations to perform on the array.

The configuration object should have the following properties:

- add: An array of numbers to add to the input array.
- subtract: An array of numbers to subtract from the input array.
- multiply: A number to multiply every element in the input array by.
- divide: A number to divide every element in the input array by.

The function should return a new array after applying the specified operations in the order they are given in the configuration object.
